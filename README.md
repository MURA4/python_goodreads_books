# 📚 Goodreads Books Analysis (Academic Project)

A hands-on data analysis project exploring book ratings, author popularity, and genre trends using a public Goodreads dataset.

## 🎯 Goal
Practice core data analysis skills: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving simple insights — as part of my data & product analytics learning journey.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 What I explored
- Distribution of book ratings and review counts  
- Most-rated authors and genres  
- Correlation between ratings, reviews, and publication year  

> 🔍 **Note**: This is an academic exercise using a publicly available dataset. No real product decisions were made based on this analysis — it's a demonstration of analytical thinking and technical execution.

## 💡 Why I did it
To strengthen my ability to:
- Ask meaningful questions about user behavior (even in non-financial contexts)  
- Clean and structure messy real-world data  
- Communicate findings clearly through visualizations  

Perfect practice for real-world product analytics!
